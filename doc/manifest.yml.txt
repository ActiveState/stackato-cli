Specification of manifest.yml
=============================

This specification describes the external representation of CF's
manifest.yml, as reverse engineered from the CF vmc client.

The client's in-memory representation of any manifest, stackato or CF
matches this representation. This means that the stackato.yml
representation (see stackato.yml.txt) has to be and is transformed to
this representation. The necessary mapping is described in a separate
document.

The data structure makes heavy use of nested yaml mappings. These are
not written explicitly, but implicitly by writing the nested key names
in a long form using the character ":" (colon, ASCII decimal 58) as
separator between the individual parts.

---                                                     ----            ---------

For interoperability with stackato and its stackato.yml file a number
of its keys are accepted as well, mostly inside of the
"applications:<appdir>:stackato" mapping. By using the "stackato" key
for this most of our extensions are neatly segregated from the normal
manifest.yml content.

Important: Where the stackato.yml keys allow multiple syntactical
variants, i.e. full and shorthand forms, the embedding used here
accepts _only_ the _full_ form of the key.

Outside of the "stackato" sub key we have the following extensions:
